/**
 Creates a "typed on" effect where each letter of the message is revealed over time.
 
 You can use `#` signs to introduce a pause as letters are typed, which can build tension or create drama.
 
 For example:
 ```
 struct ContentView: View {
     var body: some View {
         TypedText("Come with me###, and see what has been foretold#.#.#.")
             .padding()
     }
 }
 ```
