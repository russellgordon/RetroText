# RetroText

Easily use classic video game-style text in your SwiftUI application.

## Installation

To install this package, import `https://github.com/russellgordon/RetroText` in Swift Package Manager.

Here's how to do that.

Say your project happens to be named **PipersAdventure**.

Begin by accessing the **Package Dependencies** tab for your project and then using the **+** button to add a new dependency:

Then paste the [address of this package](https://github.com/russellgordon/RetroText) into the search field and select **Add Package**:

On the next dialog that appears, select **Add Package** again to add to the target for your app:

When the package has been imported, your application will look something like this:

## Usage

### Register Fonts

First, the fonts distributed within this module must be registered with the operating system from within your app.

You'll need to open the `App.swift` file *wherever* `@main` *is located*.

For example, say your project is named **PipersAdventure**, then the file you need to modify is going to be `PipersAdventureApp.swift`.

Up top, import the RetroText package. Then, add an initializer function and use the provided static function to register fonts, like so:

```swift

import RetroText
import SwiftUI

@main
struct PipersAdventureApp: App {

    init() {
        RetroText.registerFonts()
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}

```

### Usage for Static Text

To make static retro-style text appear with reasonable defaults for typeface and size:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Come with me, and see what has been foretold...")
            .retroText()
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

All that the `.retroText()` view modifier does is apply one of the custom fonts that is bundled with this module.

As desired, you can adjust the typeface:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Come with me, and see what has been foretold...")
            .retroText(font: .pixelEmulator)
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

<img width="154" alt="example2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6400195/169651292-73b68860-5c93-49e2-bf54-bcd9640506eb.png">

Or both the typeface and size:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Come with me, and see what has been foretold...")
            .retroText(font: .pixelEmulator, size: 18.0)
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

### Usage for Live Typing Effect

A common technique in classic video games was to have dialogue from the game be "spoken" to the player as a typing animation.

Be sure to read [Christopher Boynton's original article on Medium](https://medium.com/@cboynton/achieving-a-type-on-text-effect-in-swift-6934b683d1e9), from which the image above was sourced, and from which the core concepts for this package were adapted.

The typing effect alone can be achieved in your app like so â€“ note that the `.retroTextTypeEffect()` view modifier replaces the `EmptyView` with an `HStack` and an embeded `Text` view, which display the message.

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        EmptyView()
            .retroTextTypeEffect()
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

To show this with a classic video game font, apply the `.retroText` view modifier:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        EmptyView()
            .retroTextTypeEffect()
            .retroText()
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

<img height="600" alt="example-ii" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6400195/169653017-6f7ba40a-9cf4-47ad-9771-863ff532ec0e.gif">

Of course, the message, speed of typing effect, font, and font size can be customized:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        EmptyView()
            .retroTextTypeEffect(message: "Behold... the coming of a new queen!",
                                 speed: .fast)
            .retroText(font: .pixelEmulator, size: 24.0)
            .padding()
        
    }
}

```

<img height="600" alt="example-iii" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6400195/169653446-365dd3ca-3446-4e30-811a-896375019025.gif">

Finally, you can use `#` marks to introduce a slight pause for the typing effect. This can be used to build tension or drama:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
        EmptyView()
            .retroTextTypeEffect(message: "Behold#.#.#. the coming of a new### queen###!",
                                 speed: .normal)
            .retroText(font: .pixelEmulator, size: 24.0)
            .padding()
        
    }
}
```
